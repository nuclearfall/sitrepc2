## Commercial API Integration Exception (Contributor Acknowledgement)

sitrepc2 includes a **limited commercial-use exception** that permits commercial
use **only** when official, licensed third-party APIs (e.g. Twitter/X, Facebook/Meta)
are used in full compliance with their terms of service, and **only** if all
share-alike and source-availability requirements are preserved.

By contributing to this project, you acknowledge and agree that:

- Your contribution is subject to this **Commercial API Integration Exception**
- You grant the project author the right to:
  - include your contribution in versions of the software that exercise this exception
  - grant additional permissions consistent with the project’s published licensing model
    for official, ToS-compliant API integrations

This exception **does not permit**:
- proprietary or closed-source redistribution
- removal of licensing or attribution requirements
- unrestricted commercial exploitation

If you are uncomfortable with this exception or future relicensing under these
constraints, you should not contribute.

## What This Means in Practice

You are welcome to contribute if your work is intended for:

- Research
- Academic use
- Journalistic or investigative analysis
- Personal or non-commercial OSINT projects

You may **not** contribute code that:

- Is intended for unrestricted or proprietary commercial exploitation
- Is encumbered by incompatible licenses
- You do not have the authority to license under PolyForm Noncommercial terms
- Violates third-party terms of service or applicable law

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits logically scoped
- Explain behavioral changes where relevant

### Pull Requests

or use case is compatible with the project’s license or goals, please open an
issue **before** submitting a pull request.

Thank you for helping keep **sitrepc2** transparent, reproducible, and
ethically grounded in non-commercial OSINT research.
