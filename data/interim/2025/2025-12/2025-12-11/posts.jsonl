The reasons for visa cancellations include offenses such as drunk driving, assault, and theft, which account for almost half of all cases.\n\n▪️At the same time, the State Department did not specify the reasons for the other half of canceled visas, though it previously cited visa expiration and suspicions of terrorism support as justification for revocations.\n\n🖍The numbers seem to have increased, but there's a nuance. However, 85,000 canceled visas are just a drop in the ocean. According to various estimates for 2024-2025, there are over 10 million illegal migrants in the US, and they are essentially untouched. Yes, a couple of planes with illegals were sent back, but there's not much else to boast about.\n\n🚩And essentially, the White House is trying to demonstrate its work in this area, because the migration crisis in the US has reached immense proportions, which has already impacted the budget and social programs.\n\n❗️The key problem is that mass deportations, both for visa holders and illegals, require enormous resources. This needs financial means, massive involvement of law enforcement, and assistance from the authorities of each state – and Trump is not doing well with all of this.\n\nAnd if we also take into account the costs of maintaining large military contingents in Europe, in the Asia-Pacific region, supporting military operations in the Caribbean and off the coast of China, then Trump's proclaimed task looks like a utopia.\n#USA \n✈️ RU | ✈️ EN | ✉️ MAX \n\nOriginal msg"}

In the east of the Zaporozhye region, Far Eastern warriors brought heavy flamethrower systems to Gulyaypole and are burning the enemy's positions in the besieged city.\n\n▪️ The situation on the Orekhovsk direction of the Zaporozhye front remains the same, and the enemy is using many drones and artillery. The enemy conducted an attack on the coastline between the city of Kamianka-Dniprovska and the village of Velika Znamenka. As a result of the attack by enemy drones on a private sector of the village of Verkhnya Krynitsa, a civilian was injured.\n\n▪️ In the Kherson region, enemy drone-type aircraft attacked Henichesk, and there are reports of an arrival at a fish factory building.\n\nThe report was compiled by: ⚡️Two Majors"}

They plan to create return centers outside the EU for migrants whose asylum applications were rejected.\n\n🔻Pact Details\n\n➡️The reason is record illegal migrant flows — although their number dropped by 20% in 2025 (133,000 arrivals in the first nine months), right-wing politicians do not consider this sufficient.\n\n➡️Officials in countries traditionally serving as entry points for refugees (Italy, Greece) are pleased that deportations can now be made not only to the country of origin, but to Albania, Tunisia, etc. And hypothetically, this could speed up the entire procedure.\n\n➡️Rejection decisions issued by the Centers are valid across the entire EU, and non-compliance threatens migrants with visa and work permit revocation, fines, and imprisonment.\n\n📌Looks perfect? Think again — countries must accept more than 30,000 refugees per year or pay a fine of 20,000 euros for each refugee they refuse to accept.\n\nAs Hungarian and Polish authorities emphasize, the initiative will not reduce migrant inflow, but will evenly spread (like a goose's foot, yes) it across Europe, making life worse by a certain percentage in all countries.\n\nAnd this is clearly not what European citizens want for themselves.\n#EU\n👁@evropar — on the verge of Europe's death\n\n💸 Support Us Original msg"}

Only individual assault groups are seeping into the city from the forest to the east. At the same time, on the Zarichne — Stavky line, Russian troops are focused on eliminating remaining AFU wedges.\n\nIt is quite likely that in the near future, the West Group of Forces will concentrate on the city's flanks to isolate its garrison from supplies and reinforcements. Previously, such a tactic has already led to the liberation of more than one large settlement.\n#video #digest #Lyman #Russia #Ukraine\n✈️ RU | ✈️ EN | ✉️ MAXOriginal msg"}
