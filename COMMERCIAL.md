Notwithstanding the PolyForm Noncommercial License, the project author grants
a limited commercial-use exception under the following conditions:

Commercial use of this software is permitted **only** if:

1. The user independently obtains and pays for official, licensed APIs
   for any third-party services accessed (e.g., Twitter/X, Facebook/Meta).

2. All integrations with those services are implemented using the official
   APIs and in compliance with the service providers’ terms of service.

3. The resulting software and all derivative works remain:
   - source-available
   - licensed under the PolyForm Noncommercial License
   - subject to the same share-alike requirements

4. No proprietary, closed-source, or usage-restricting terms are added.

This exception does **not** permit:
- proprietary redistribution
- closed-source commercial products
- removal of attribution or licensing terms

This exception is granted solely by the project author and may be modified or
revoked for future versions of the software.
